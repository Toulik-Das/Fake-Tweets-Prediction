### Introduction :

   Over the years, Twitter has grown to become an important medium of communication. Dubbed as possibly the most impactful type of journalism in a raw form, when combined with the ubiquitousness of smartphones, emergency news can be announced and observed in real-time. As a result, many agencies (e.x. disaster relief organizations and news agencies) are eager to programmatically monitor Twitter. However, this comes with its own complications. Distinguishing whether a person’s words is announcing big stormz, or referring to UK Grime artist Stormzy as big Stormz could raise some challenges (a rather radical example to say the least).
     
### Description Of  The Project :
   In this Project, I aim to show ways to explore unstructured data. I use the “Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets” dataset from Kaggle.
Kaggle splits the data into train and test set. We build our model on the train set to predict the instances in the test set.


### Requirements :

  * Python 3.3+
  * Pandas : For data manipulation and analysis
  * Numpy : A general purpose array-processing package
  * Matplotlib , Seaborn & plotly: Visualizations library
  * Tensorflow :  Open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks.
  * NLTK: works with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing(NLP)
